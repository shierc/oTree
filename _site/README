This website is build on Pixyll theme for Jekyll.

The wiki is build using modified version of
this ruby script https://github.com/djacquel/WikiToJekyll
I have added wiki menu generation function into the original script.

To rebuild wiki you need to run this code

    rake wikibuild

It should automatically fetch new version of wiki from 
repository and reshape it for the website.
